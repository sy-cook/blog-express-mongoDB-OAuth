A simple daily journal website expanding on a project from London App Brewery Web Dev course.

Features MongoDB integration and Passport.js Google OAuth, and a naive login access (for write privs) based on database Google ID lookup.

## TODO:
- Implement more sophisticated method for restricting login access: <a>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13657162/restricting-login-access-passport-js-google-authentication</a>
